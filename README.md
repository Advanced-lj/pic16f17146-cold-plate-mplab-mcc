# Intelligent Cooling Plate with PIC16F17146

Packed with more peripherals than I/O pins, this intelligent cooling plate (aka: the cold plate) cools its metal surface and anything on top of it. Controlling this system is a single 20-pin, 8-bit MCU, which performs temperature measurements, peltier current monitoring, user interface control, and safety functions. The MCU can handle this task single-handedly thanks to its wide array of Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs).

This README covers a brief usage guide, and other surface level info about the demo. The cold plate was made so that different aspects/functionalities of the microcontroller could be copied/adapted to various applications, rather than someone would building up their own cold plate. Because of this, there is no how-to guide to build up the hardware. However, all PCB, CAD files, and non-standard BOM components are included in the repo for reference.

## Major Functions
These are the major functions are implemented on the microcontroller.

**Current Monitoring and Measurement**  
- Integrated Operational Amplifier (OPA1)  
- Analog Comparators 1 and 2 (CMP1 and CMP2)  
- Digital-to-Analog Converters 1 and 2 (DAC1, DAC2) 
- Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC)
- Fixed Voltage Reference (FVR)

OPA1 is implemented as a current-sense amplifier, which amplifies the small voltage across the current shunt resistor. The output of OPA1 is also used internally for monitoring and measurement. 

The amplified current sense output of OPA1 is compared to a small, set voltage level (from DAC1) using CMP1. If it is greater, CMP1 is high, indiciating current is flowing through the system.

DAC2/CMP2 work in the same way, but is used to monitor for overcurrent. If the DAC2 value is exceeded by the OP-AMP output, the MCU will shutdown the Peltier plate. 

Additionally, the current is measured for telemetry by the ADCC, with the FVR providing the appropriate voltage reference.

**Cold Plate, Heatsink, and MCU Temperature Monitoring**
- Analog-to-Digital Converter with Computation (ADCC)
- Fixed Voltage Reference (FVR)
- Temperature Indicator Module (TEMP)

The microcontroller monitors the temperature in the system by measuring NTC thermistors for the top plate and its heatsink. It also monitors the internal temperature of the MCU die with the TEMP peripheral. The ADCC uses the FVR to ensure measurements are stable, and to provide the appropriate voltage for the TEMP peripheral. 

**Functional Safety Supported Setting Storage**
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) with Memory Scanner 
- Non-Voltatile Memory (NVM) Control

Using the NVM and CRC CIPs, user settings are saved to EEPROM along with a CRC checksum. On startup, the checksum is re-validated to ensure data integrity. The CRC reduces code size and runs faster than software could perform by offloading it to dedicated hardware.
 
**Protective System Monitoring**
- Timer 0 (TMR0)
- Windowed Watchdog Timer (WWDT)

Since the cold plate involves high currents and potentially hazardous temperatures, the WWDT is used to ensure periodic monitoring of the device is performed. If the WWDT is not triggered within a specific time, the microcontroller will reset. This ensures that if the firmware ever deadlocked, the system would not remain active, thus ensuring safety is not compromised. TMR0 generates the base timing for the periodic self-check.

**Single Speed Fan Control with Dual Fan Speed Monitoring**
- Pulse Width Modulator with Compare 2 (PWM2)
- Timer 2 and 4 (TMR2 and TMR4)

To cool the Peltier plate, a PWM CIP is used to generate a speed control signal for the system fans. This allows the fans to ramp up and down depending on the conditions of the system. Additionally, the tachometer signals from the fans are monitored and counted by TMR2 and TMR4. If Fan 1 is not spinning (or stops spinning), the microcontroller will not power-up the Peltier plate. 

**User Interface**
- Host Synchronous Serial Port 1 (MSSP1), in I<sup>2</sup>C mode
- Timer 1 and 3 (TMR1 and TMR3)
- Configurable Logic Cell 1 and 2 (CLC1 and CLC2)
- Pulse Width Modulator with Compare 1 (PWM1)

The user interacts with the cold plate through a pushbutton rotary encoder and an OLED display. The OLED is controlled with an on-chip MSSP1 peripheral via I<sup>2</sup>C. Since there is dedicated MSSP hardware, the CPU can load data into the module, rather than bit-banging the I/O lines. 

The rotary encoder inputs go into 2 CLCs CIPs to convert the signal into clockwise and counter-clockwise pulses (depending on direction). The pulses go into TMR1 and TMR3, which act as counters. The CPU can read the counters later to calculate the net rotation.

Lastly, the rotary encoder has 2 LEDs built-in - an orange and a blue LED. Using PWM1, these LEDs are used for a visual indication of the cold plate's status:

| Color | Cold Plate Status |
| --- | --- |
| Breathing Purple | Standby |
| Breathing Blue | Actively Cooling |
| Sold Blue | At Target Temperature |
| Solid Orange | Error |

**Debug Print**
- Enhanced Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver
Transmitter (EUSART1)

EUSART1 is used to transmit debug messages from the microcontroller. It is setup to run at 115200 baud, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit. 

## Operation

On boot, a standby screen shows the current plate temperature, the set temperature, and whether the product is in demo mode (which limits the lowest temperature for safety).

![Main Menu](images/main_menu.jpg)

Pressing the rotary encoder button brings up a menu that can be used to change various running parameters:

| Name | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Go Back | Returns to Standby screen |
| Start | Turns on plate, go to running status screen |
| Set Temperature | Changes target temperature |
| Hysteresis | Configures temperature hysteresis |
| Change Units | Selects Celsius or Fahrenheit units|
| Show Icons | Displays text or icons in running status screen |
| About | Lists developer and version info |
| Demo Mode Toggle | Password protected way to disable demo mode|

![Top Menu](images/top_menu.jpg)
![Bottom Menu](images/bottom_menu.jpg)

Upon pressing `Start`, the MCU begins checking for various errors, and if all checks pass, the plate power is enabled and the user is brought to a running status screen which shows the plate target temp, current temp, heatsink temp, MCU temp, current being drawn, and heatsink fan RPM.

![Running Menu](images/running.jpg)

If an error occurs, power to the plate is cut, and a troubleshooting error message displays on the screen. Press the rotary encoder to clear the error and return to the standy screen. If the error is not remedied and the plate is started again, it will loop back to the same error screen.

![Error Menu](images/error.jpg)

Below is a list of the various possible errors that are continuously checked for during running operation:

| Name | Error Code | Cause |
| ---- | ----------- |--- |
| PELTIER_FAN1_ERROR | 1 | The heatsink fan is unplugged |
| PELTIER_OVERCURRENT_ERROR | 2 | More current is pulled than software allows |
| PELTIER_POWER_ERROR | 3 | No power is detected when the plate should be pulling current |
| PELTIER_GAIN_ERROR | 4 | The gain of the operational amplifier exceeds expected tolerance.
| PELTIER_INT_OVERHEAT | 5 | Internal MCU temperature is too hot (70C)|
| PELTIER_HEATSINK_OVERHEAT | 6 | Heatsink is too hot (80C)|
| PELTIER_SENSE_HOT_OPEN | 7 | Thermocouple for heatsink is disconnected |
| PELTIER_SENSE_COLD_OPEN | 8 | Thermocouple for plate temp is disconnected |
| PELTIER_PLATE_TEMP_LIMIT | 9 | Cold plate is below safe temperature |

Once started, pressing the rotary encoder button and selecting `Cancel` stops the plate and returns to the standby menu.
